CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /root/new_egm/build/release/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /root/egm2/build/release where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/root/new_egm/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/root/egm2/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
